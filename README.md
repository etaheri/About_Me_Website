Resume type website exploring new svg techniques, animations, and skel.js

## Description
Wanted to explore using new SVG techniques that swapped to a png or jpg when they could not be viewed.

I also wanted to explore using the skel.js framework for responsiveness of the site. It is an extremely
lite framework that loads the required css file based on the size of the viewers screen.  It is a cool 
alternative to css media queries.
